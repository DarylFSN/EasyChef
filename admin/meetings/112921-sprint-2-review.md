- Elias Arghand:   
  - Helped connect frontend and backend pages for the MVP. Completed CRUD functions from Firebase and modified the database schema to store user created recipes. Also deployed the website using Netlify.

- Jasmine Wang:
  - Tried to connect the pages and created icons such as the delete icon.

- Jonathan Padungyothee:   
  - This sprint I added a check functionality to pull requests, added citation to all community GitHub Actions code, fixed the target of the auto-linter, created a script to automate testing on pushes to main / pull requests, and started working on e2e tests.


- Lavanya Verma:  
  - Since the last sprint, I have worked on connecting pages and fixed bugs on styling with uploadRecipe page when minimized getting unaligned. Added functionality to the save button and fixed the reroute issue. Helped out on the firebase rules and database structure.


- Likith Palabindela: 
  - Tried unit testing functions, but they were all API function calls that couldnâ€™t be tested. Instead, I started working on end-to-end testing, starting with the sign up and login pages.

- Madelyn Mirai Adams:    




- Naweed Malal:  
  - Modified the recipe page to load recipe information, created edit recipe page, worked with backend to finalize CRUD features, and modified recipe cards.

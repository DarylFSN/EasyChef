**Mad/Sad/Glad Topics**   
- Sad: Time Constraints
  - Not enough time to perfect everything & we also have to work alongside finals/week 10 work
  - Can't change this constraint too much due to structure of the class and quarter system but we are on a good pace with our MVP
- Sad: Not enough pair programming / group work
  - There was one coding session but as we wind down to the end of the quarter it is tough to schedule more
  - Group coding sessio was very productive and paired programming is just as effective

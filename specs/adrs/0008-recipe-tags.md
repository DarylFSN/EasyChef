# Recipe Tags
## Context and Problem Statement

Tags for recipes can help users filter by more specific criteria, which could possibly add more complexity. We are deciding if we should add this feature or not.

## Considered Options

* Keep tags
* Keep tags with preset options (no user created tags)
* Remove the feature

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options:

* Remove the feature

* We decided that adding tags was not a feature that we should prioritize, as the rest of the website pages and features needed to be working properly before we added another feature. Adding this particular feature would take time away from finishing the project. Tags also serve as another filtering system, and since we already have a filtering system in place, it wouldn't make sense to double filter.
